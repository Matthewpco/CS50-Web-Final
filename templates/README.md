## ðŸš€ Getting Started
This project is available online at , or if you want to run it locally follow the instructions below:

- You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/) installed on your computer to run this application.
- In your terminal to install dependencies execute:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- Define application as Flask if needed:
```
Unix Bash (Linux, Mac, etc.):

$ export FLASK_APP=application.py

Windows CMD:

$ set FLASK_APP=application.py
```
- Finally to start the web server run:
```
$ flask run 
```
